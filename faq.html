			<h3 class="question">Can I claim funding to help with course payments?</h3>
			<p class="answer">You can apply for funding from https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/overview You can also apply the university for funding such as bursaries. Funding will usually be means tested so any amounts received can differ person to person.</p>

			<h3 class="question">How much time can I expect to spend in the classroom?</h3>
			<p class="answer">On average you will probably spend about 16 hours in the classroom though this can depend on your course.</p>
			
			<h3 class="question">Will I spend time studying independently?</h3>
			<p class="answer">Yes you can expect to spend at least the same hours on independent study as you will in the classroom. However, independent study doesn’t mean you have to sit cooked up in your room, you can study with your course mates – this can be a great way of getting some studying in a social environment.</p>
			
			<h3 class="question">When on campus, is  there anywhere I can chill out and relax?</h3>
			<p class="answer">There are plenty of places to relax on campus. Edge Hill University is a great environment for both study and a little relaxation. Whether you go to The Hub, the student bar, or just relax at the lakeside watching the ducks. If you really need some quiet time, the library has a floor dedicated to silent study/reading, etc.</p>
			
			<h3 class="question">Ok I’m chilled out, where can I party?</h3>
			<p class="answer">Aside the student bar, Edge Hill is just outside Ormskirk town centre, where there are bars and restaurants. But if you really want to let your hair down, you are half an hour (on train) away from Liverpool city centre, which offers plenty of nightlife for all tastes.</p>
			
			<h3 class="question">If I live off campus, how easy is it to get to the university?</h3>
			<p class="answer">By car, EHU is just off the M58 which is easily accessible from the M6. Ormskirk town centre is easily accessible via public transport and the university is about twenty minutes walk from there – a pleasant walk in good weather. However, Edge Hill University also provides a free bus route from the town centre (right by the bus depot and train station) which drops you off at the campus.</p>
