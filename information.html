				Information
			</h1>
			<p>
				If there is one major tip I would give you when studying on any course, it's be proactive about undertaking your study and assignment tasks. Assignment deadlines come very quickly and often there is more than one assignment due at a certain time. If you don't plan your time and tackle your work head on - then the last few weeks before a deadline can be very stressful and a nightmare for your social life!</p>
			<p>
				Below is some general information about the University staff and support.

				<h2>Facilities</h2>
				<p>The university has many great facilities to help make your time studying as comfortable and productive as possible. As well as the expected classroom environments, other facilities include a very well stocked library. Computer systems available for use in venues all around the campus. The HUB is a great place to grab a bite and relax a little between lessons. A fully furnished Gym with student rates for memberships. And of course when you have come to the end of a hard week the Student Bar is a great place to chill out and relax. These are just a few examples of the facilities available.</p>

				<h2>Teaching Staff</h2>
				<p>
					In my experience, I have found the staff to be very helpful, approachable and supportive of students and their endeavours. When deadlines are fast approaching the tutors are always ready to help provide advice and guidance to those who may be finding a task challenging. As well as time with the tutors, there are also drop insessions run by fellow students on their second or third year studies. These are provided to provide support with your assignments when necessary, but they also benefit the students who run the sessions as they gain experience supporting others.

				<h2>Support Staff</h2>
				<p>
					The university has many student support and welfare staff who can be contacted at Student Support. The staff are there to help you with any problems or issues you may be facing whilst studying and can provide help and support when needed. This can include financial advice, gereral welfare, etc. There are also many societies that you can join, these are very varied and include interest groups and study support groups etc.
